    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Basundi (Gujarati: બાસુંદી, Kannada: ಬಾಸುಂದಿ, Marathi: बासुंदी, Tamil: பாசந்தி, Telugu: బాసుంది) is an Indian sweet mostly in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. It is a sweetened condensed milk made by boiling milk on low heat until the milk is reduced by half. In North India, a similar dish goes by the name rabri. It is often made on Hindu festivals such as Kali Chaudas and Bhaubeej (Bhai Dooj).</p>
    <p>Different styles of basundi are also prepared, such as sitaphal (custard apple) basundi and angoor basundi (basundi with smaller kinds of rasgullas). </p>
